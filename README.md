# 🧠 Daily Logic Code Training

Welcome to my **Logic Code Solutions** repository!  
This is where I upload my daily coding exercises focused on logic, problem solving, and algorithmic thinking.  

📍 **Purpose**:  
Sharpen my problem-solving skills through consistent, hands-on coding practice.

🧩 **What's inside**:  
- 🔢 Logical and algorithmic challenges  
- 🧪 Code kata-style solutions  
- 🧠 Practice problems from various sources  
- 🗂️ Organized by date or topic (depending on the challenge)

🛠 **Tech stack**:  
- Language: JAVA, JavaScript and HTML (for now)  
- Tools: VSCode,IntelliJ, Git, and a lot of caffeine ☕

📆 **Study Workflow**  
Every day I follow this structured routine:
1. ⏱ **10-minute logic challenge** — Solve a logic-based problem quickly and cleanly  
2. 📖 **Concept review** — Revisit a specific programming concept or technique  
3. 🔧 **Focused coding** — Work on a language-specific problem or a personal project  

📈 **Why this repo?**  
Because real growth comes from consistency. This is my personal space to:
- 📚 Track progress  
- 🚀 Improve speed and accuracy  
- 🧹 Refactor and learn from past solutions
